This directory contains five main subdirectory for the model:
- **MIMOsolver**: the main directory contains all the necessary code to simulate data, deconvolve bulk tumor with different information and to do the analysis on the results. More details can be found in [MIMOsolver/README.md](MIMOsolver/README.md)
- **data**: a directory to contain the real data. Since the real data is not legible to be public, we provide simulated SCS data according to the real data. More information can be found in [data/README.md](data/README.md), also can be found in our previous work: [_Bulk and Single-Cell Copy Number Deconvolution_, *Lei et al*](https://github.com/leovam/SCS_deconvolution/tree/master/schwartzlab/data)
- **results**: a directory to save the raw output and statistic output
- **simulation**: a directory to store the simulated data
- **tests**: we provide some command lines for running the model
